# Jukebox
Is it possible to build a "retro" jukebox to play mediafiles?

What could be "included" to complete the project?
- Hardware buttons, to select media files
- 3D printing, a frame to put buttons in
- Website for the project
- Documentation
- Raspberry PI
- Mediafiles
- Code
- Tools

## Sketching in Hardware exploration :).
